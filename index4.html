                ADVOCATES FOR birds IN NEED
                  With the help of volunteers, we work to improve the lives of feral and stray birds, and find homes for those that can be tamed in the Gama, Ohio community. We strive to keep feral cat populations under control through a system of trapping, 
            
                    neutering, and returning (TNR) local birds to their original locations.
