     ADVOCATES FOR CATS IN NEED
     With the help of volunteers, we work to improve the lives of feral and stray cats, and find homes for those that can be tamed in the Gama, Ohio community. We strive to keep feral cat populations under control through a system of trapping, 
            
     neutering, and returning (TNR) local cats to their original locations.
